Chapter One

The Cat's Eye

I grew up an only child, and as far back as I can remember I was nervous around girls. I was nearly sixteen when I met Simone, a girl my own age, at a chicken farm in X. We were distant cousins but quickly became good friends. Three days after we first met, Simone and I were alone in her villa. She was wearing a black pinafore with a white collar. She seemed to be as nervous as I was!

She had on long black socks that went all the way up to her knees. She had a pet cat named Margaret (which I think is a beautiful name for a cat). Margaret sometimes liked to come out and play but much of the time stayed snuggled up under her skirt. Sometimes I could catch a glimpse of Margaret's tail peeking out below the hemline.

In the corner of one hallway in Simone's villa was a saucer of milk. "That's my kitty's milk," said Margaret. "Would you like to see my kitty have some of the milk?"

"I'd love to!" I answered enthusiastically. I hoped that Margaret would get along well with Pierre, my pet rooster, who was scratching around by the corner. Pierre followed me everywhere.

It was a very hot day. "Come on out, kitty," she coaxed, but Margaret was feeling shy. Simone gave a shrug and put the saucer on a small bench, then put one foot on the bench, covering the saucer up with the hem of her dress. I could hear the cat's claws scraping around on the wooden bench, then there was a splash as the jumped into the saucer. I could barely catch a glimpse of Margaret's tail and little feet peeking out from under the hem.

All the noise attracted Pierre's attention as well. As soon as he heard the splashing and scratching, he gave a cluck and hopped into my lap to get a better look!

Suddenly Simone stood up and gathered up the cat in her skirts. "Naughty kitty!" she scolded. Milk was dripping onto the floor, and I saw Simone take a handkerchief to wipe off Margaret's little paws. Pierre went stiff at the sight, and I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck to make sure he couldn't get up to any more mischief. When Simone saw this, she and I started laughing uncontrollably at the same time. It was as if we were tickling each other without touching each other!

When Simone's mother came home, Simone reached up and gave her a big hug. The hem of her skirt rose up and I got a view of Margaret's tail and rear haunches. I was sad that it was time to go home. I wanted to pet the kitty as well, but she was too shy! I settled for just quickly touching the tip of her tail before I said goodbye.

That evening I went home and Pierre the rooster followed me, clucking and bobbing his head. I stayed up all night playing with him and thinking how much fun it would be to play with a cute kitty. The next day when I saw Simone, she saw the dark circles I had under my eyes from staying up all night.

"Were you playing with Pierre without me?" she asked.

"Yes," I admitted.

"Don't play with him without me," she said. "And don't stay up all night playing with him or you'll both be too tired to play with me and my kitty!"

After that, Simone and I became best friends. We saw each other nearly every week. Margaret was still being shy, especially when Pierre was around (which was nearly always), but it was nice knowing that she was snuggled up under Simone's skirt.

One day our families took a trip in the countryside and we rode along in the back seat, watching the scenery go by in a blur out the car windows. Suddenly we saw a very pretty girl on a bicycle, riding down the wrong side of the road.

"Watch out," Simone said to her uncle, who was driving the car. Her uncle swerved, but it was too late. He hit the poor girl on the bicycle, who let out a squeal and bounced right off of her bike into the ditch!

Her uncle pulled the car over immediately to make sure she was alright. She had landed right in a bramble bush! She had brambles stuck to her everywhere and her hair was badly messed up!

"Are you alright?" Simone shouted to her.

"I'm okay," called out the cyclist. "But I've certainly had better Tuesdays!"

We all laughed at her funny appearance. Margaret gave a meow from under Simone's skirts, and even Pierre made some clucks that sounded like laughter!

We sat there for awhile laughing at what we had seen. The horror and despair at seeing the cyclist nearly injured was frightening, but the laughter was cathartic and reminded me of how much we had laughed the first time Simone's kitty had made a mess with the milk.

Simone was tall and very pretty. She had bright eyes and usually wore a big smile. And we shared a lot in common. Even if we hated to admit it, seeing accidental chaos like the cyclist being thrown into a ditch made us laugh even if it shouldn't. We secretly wanted her to do it again so we could watch!

It was a long time that summer before Simone's cat Margaret was comfortable enough to come out to play. I saw Simone frequently, but the cat always cowered under her skirts.

One day Simone and I were wrestling around and playing with our squirtguns and she had me lie on the ground. She hiked up her dress and stepped over me, and I could feel Margaret clambering around on my stomach with her gentle little paws.

Margaret stepped off me and then lay down next to me on her back, facing the opposite direction. She put her legs in the air, balancing her cat on her feet.

"See if you can hit Margaret with your squirt gun!" she insisted.

"If I do that, then all the water will end up on your dress and your face," I protested.

"That's okay, do it anyway," said Simone. I squirted my squirtgun several times in the air. Some of the squirt landed on her face and dress, but most of it arced over and hit her kitty, who yowled and hissed and made us both laugh heartily.

The smell of the sea mixed with the smell of wet linen, wet from my squirt gun.Evening was breaking, and we stayed on the ground in the same position, tranquil and motionless, just enjoying each other's presence. All at once we heard steps tramping through the grass.

"Don't move," Simone ordered.

The steps stopped, but we couldn't see who was coming. We both held our breaths.I imagined that if anyone saw us, especially Simone with her legs in the air balancing her cat under her skirts, they would stop and feel compelled to watch and laugh. We heard the steps resume, faster this time, almost running. Suddenly we saw the source of the footsteps, a beautiful blonde girl around our own age. It was Marcelle, the most innocent and dramatic of our friends. She spotted us and burst into tears, perhaps imagining something awful had happened to us. She threw herself on the ground in despair, and only then did we get up and approach her.

"Watch this," Simone told me, pulling up the hem of Marcelle's dress. Marcelle had her own secret hidden under her dress, a fluffy ginger cat named Coco. We both petted Coco, who seemed to enjoy the attention, while Marcelle continued crying from having seen us lying motionless on the ground.
