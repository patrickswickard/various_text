Chapter One

The Cat's Eye

I grew up an only child, and as far back as I can remember I was nervous around girls. I was nearly eighteen when I met Simone, a girl my own age, at a chicken farm in X. We were distant cousins but quickly became good friends. Three days after we first met, Simone and I were alone in her villa. She was wearing a black pinafore with a white collar. She seemed to be as nervous as I was!

She had on long black socks that went all the way up to her knees. She had a pet cat named Margaret (which I think is a beautiful name for a cat). Margaret sometimes liked to come out and play but much of the time stayed snuggled up under her skirt. Sometimes I could catch a glimpse of Margaret's tail peeking out below the hemline.

In the corner of one hallway in Simone's villa was a saucer of milk. "That's my kitty's milk," said Margaret. "Would you like to see my kitty have some of the milk?"

"I'd love to!" I answered enthusiastically. I hoped that Margaret would get along well with Pierre, my pet rooster, who was scratching around by the corner. Pierre followed me everywhere.

It was a very hot day. "Come on out, kitty," she coaxed, but Margaret was feeling shy. Simone gave a shrug and put the saucer on a small bench, then put one foot on the bench, covering the saucer up with the hem of her dress. I could hear the cat's claws scraping around on the wooden bench, then there was a splash as the jumped into the saucer. I could barely catch a glimpse of Margaret's tail and little feet peeking out from under the hem.

All the noise attracted Pierre's attention as well. As soon as he heard the splashing and scratching, he gave a cluck and hopped into my lap to get a better look!

Suddenly Simone stood up and gathered up the cat in her skirts. "Naughty kitty!" she scolded. Milk was dripping onto the floor, and I saw Simone take a handkerchief to wipe off Margaret's little paws. Pierre went stiff at the sight, and I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck to make sure he couldn't get up to any more mischief. When Simone saw this, she and I started laughing uncontrollably at the same time. It was as if we were tickling each other without touching each other!

When Simone's mother came home, Simone reached up and gave her a big hug. The hem of her skirt rose up and I got a view of Margaret's tail and rear haunches. I was sad that it was time to go home. I wanted to pet the kitty as well, but she was too shy! I settled for just quickly touching the tip of her tail before I said goodbye.

That evening I went home and Pierre the rooster followed me, clucking and bobbing his head. I stayed up all night playing with him and thinking how much fun it would be to play with a cute kitty. The next day when I saw Simone, she saw the dark circles I had under my eyes from staying up all night.

"Were you playing with Pierre without me?" she asked.

"Yes," I admitted.

"Don't play with him without me," she said. "And don't stay up all night playing with him or you'll both be too tired to play with me and my kitty!"

After that, Simone and I became best friends. We saw each other nearly every week. Margaret was still being shy, especially when Pierre was around (which was nearly always), but it was nice knowing that she was snuggled up under Simone's skirt.

One day our families took a trip in the countryside and we rode along in the back seat, watching the scenery go by in a blur out the car windows. Suddenly we saw a very pretty girl on a bicycle, riding down the wrong side of the road.

"Watch out," Simone said to her uncle, who was driving the car. Her uncle swerved, but it was too late. He hit the poor girl on the bicycle, who let out a squeal and bounced right off of her bike into the ditch!

Her uncle pulled the car over immediately to make sure she was alright. She had landed right in a bramble bush! She had brambles stuck to her everywhere and her hair was badly messed up!

"Are you alright?" Simone shouted to her.

"I'm okay," called out the cyclist. "But I've certainly had better Tuesdays!"

We all laughed at her funny appearance. Margaret gave a meow from under Simone's skirts, and even Pierre made some clucks that sounded like laughter!

We sat there for awhile laughing at what we had seen. The horror and despair at seeing the cyclist nearly injured was frightening, but the laughter was cathartic and reminded me of how much we had laughed the first time Simone's kitty had made a mess with the milk.

Simone was tall and very pretty. She had bright eyes and usually wore a big smile. And we shared a lot in common. Even if we hated to admit it, seeing accidental chaos like the cyclist being thrown into a ditch made us laugh even if it shouldn't. We secretly wanted her to do it again so we could watch!

It was a long time that summer before Simone's cat Margaret was comfortable enough to come out to play. I saw Simone frequently, but the cat always cowered under her skirts.

One day Simone and I were wrestling around and playing with our squirtguns and she had me lie on the ground. She hiked up her dress and stepped over me, and I could feel Margaret clambering around on my stomach with her gentle little paws.

Margaret stepped off me and then lay down next to me on her back, facing the opposite direction. She put her legs in the air, balancing her cat on her feet.

"See if you can hit Margaret with your squirt gun!" she insisted.

"If I do that, then all the water will end up on your dress and your face," I protested.

"That's okay, do it anyway," said Simone. I squirted my squirtgun several times in the air. Some of the squirt landed on her face and dress, but most of it arced over and hit her kitty, who yowled and hissed and made us both laugh heartily.

The smell of the sea mixed with the smell of wet linen, wet from my squirt gun.Evening was breaking, and we stayed on the ground in the same position, tranquil and motionless, just enjoying each other's presence. All at once we heard steps tramping through the grass.

"Don't move," Simone ordered.

The steps stopped, but we couldn't see who was coming. We both held our breaths.I imagined that if anyone saw us, especially Simone with her legs in the air balancing her cat under her skirts, they would stop and feel compelled to watch and laugh. We heard the steps resume, faster this time, almost running. Suddenly we saw the source of the footsteps, a beautiful blonde girl around our own age. It was Marcelle, the most innocent and dramatic of our friends. She spotted us and burst into tears, perhaps imagining something awful had happened to us. She threw herself on the ground in despair, and only then did we get up and approach her.

"Watch this," Simone told me, pulling up the hem of Marcelle's dress. Marcelle had her own secret hidden under her dress, a fluffy ginger cat named Coco. We both petted Coco, who seemed to enjoy the attention, while Marcelle continued crying from having seen us lying motionless on the ground.

"Meow!" declared Coco contentedly as her mistress continued sobbing on the grass. Coco rolled around in the sun happily for all to see as we scratched him, behind his ears and over his belly, gently at first and then a bit more roughly as he got used to our caresses.

"Don't cry, Marcelle," Simone pleaded, giving her a kiss on the cheek as the hot tears streamed down her face. She smoothed Marcelle's hair, trying to calm down the hysterical girl.

Meanwhile the sky had turned quite thundery and fat drops of rain began falling on the field. The cool rain felt good after an oppressively hot day, and even Margaret and Coco were enjoying the change in weather. The sea was loudly raging, even at times drowning out the sound of the thunder. Coco and Margaret began playing with each other, and the flashes of lightning in the sky would illuminate the two adorable kitties, who soon tired out and lay motionless next to each other, purring happily. The respite didn't last long, and soon all five of us were playing together, rolling the cats around on the ground and encouraging them to play fight as we wrestled each other. The storm gathered in intensity, as if mirroring our mood, and our grappling soon ended all of us in a quickly growing puddle of mud. Simone smeared the mud on herself, laughing, and clumps of it stuck in the fur of the two cats who were quickly becoming drenched and exhausted from their exertions. In a frenzy, Simone proceeded to smear mud so violently on the little ginger cat Coco that I feared for his safety and felt obligated to intervene. I splashed her face with the muddy water to bring her back to reality.

Chapter Two
The Antique Wardrobe

That was the period when Simone developed a mania for breaking eggs by sitting on them, like some sort of demented hen. At times she would get very creative with this process. Occasionally she would do a headstand on an armchair in the parlor, resting her back against the back of the chair, her legs bent towards me. I would carefully balance an egg on her bottom and then I would squirt her in the face with my squirtgun. As soon as the water hit her face, she would kick and break the egg, which would drip down and make a mess, which we would then have to clean up.

Once her mother walked in while we were in the midst of this strange ritual. We braced ourselves for a scolding, but it never came. The poor woman was too shocked and flabbergasted by the sight of us to say anything, and she turned around and walked back out. But as we were finishing up we noticed her mother lingering in the doorway, peeking around the frame at us.

"Just pretend she isn't there," Simone suggested as we began cleaning up the mess. After we were done we left the room, leaving her shocked mother standing against the wall as if she were merely part of a family portrait.

A few days later, however, when Simone and I were wrestling and having a squirtgun fight in the rafters of the egg barn, Simone accidentally squirted her squirtgun at her mother, who had the misfortune to be passing by beneath us at just the wrong time. The poor woman looked so shocked and pathetic that we both had to stifle our laughter out of respect for her. I buried my face in Margaret's pelt to keep from guffawing aloud.

More than a week had passed without seeing our new blonde friend Marcelle and her adorable kitty Coco when we ran into them on the street one day. The blonde girl, so naive and pious, blushed bright pink at the sight of us as she remembered the mischief she had been compelled to participate in and the muddy state we had left her in. Simone gave her a big hug.

"Please forgive us, Marcelle," Simone said. "We're sorry we were such a bad influence on you the other day. I hope we can still be friends. I promise we'll never get you into another such crazy situation."

Marcelle, who was easily swayed, forgave us and agreed to come over and join us for tea with some friends that afternoon at our place. But instead of tea we ended up drinking a lot of sugary drinks, which left everyone in an excited mood.

The sight of Marcelle blushing had completely overwhelmed us. We understood each other, Simone and I, and we were determined that together we could achieve anything we put our minds to. Besides Marcelle, there were three other pretty girls and two boys here. The oldest of the eight of us was just shy of nineteen years old. Everyone was getting hyperactive from the sugary drinks and desserts, but Simone decided to ramp up the excitement by putting a jazz record on the phonograph. Simone did a silly dance to the madcap music and urged the other girls to join in, which they did willingly and quite enthusiastically. Only Marcelle, who was too shy, refused to participate in the dancing.

Finally Simone, in a sugary frenzy, seized a fine tablecloth from one of the side tables, crumpled it up, and offered to make a bet as she fetched her squirtguns from the other room.

"I bet I can hit this tablecloth with my squirtgun from across the room," she declared.

It was basically a ridiculous part of mostly turbulent and boastful youngsters, and one of the boys took her up on the bet. It was agreed that the winner would fix the penalty.

Naturally, Simone did not waver for an instant. She hit the expensive tablecloth with her squirtgun not once, not twice, but several times. The tablecloth was soaked with water, and everyone laughed at the sight.

"Since the winner decides the penalty," Simone said to the loser, "I declare that you have to bow down and give my cat Margaret a big smooch!" She presented her fuzzy black cat to the poor boy as if she were his queen. He took a deep bow, then sunk to his knees and pressed his face in her fur as everyone laughed. Everyone except Marcelle, of course, who had been getting increasingly uncomfortable since the jazz music started and who had for several minutes already been begging me to let her leave.

"We promised we wouldn't get you in trouble, Marcelle. Why do you want to leave?"

"Just because," she replied stubbornly, a violent rage gradually coming over her.

All at once, to everyone's horror, Simone dropped to the floor, clutching her little black cat Margaret in her hands. A convulsion shook her harder and harder. Clearly the sugar buzz had kicked in! Her clothes were in disarray and her bum was in the air and she shook as if she were having an epileptic fit. She rolled around at the feet of the boy who had lost the bet, mumbling almost inarticulately.

"Everyone squirt me...squirt me with the squirt guns! Squirt my kitty too!" She repeated this over and over, as if she were dying of thirst.

Marcelle gaped at this spectacle. She blushed again, her face turning bright red. She scooped up Coco and held him close, offering him to me to give him a few strokes as tears streamed down her face. I gave her a kiss on the cheek, and then she glided across the room to a large antique bridal wardrobe that sat in the ccorner. After whispering a few words to Simone, she opened the door of the wardrobe and then shut herself inside with her cat and one of the squirtguns, trying to avoid the chaos outside. We knocked on the door but she begged to be left in peace.

At this point we were all quite hyperactive from the sugary drinks and snacks, and a general chaos ensued. The girls were still dancing in a frenzy as the boys took turns squirting them with the squirtguns, getting their clothes and the furniture in the room all soaked. Some of the girls were slamming against the wardrobe in their dancing frenzy. All at once, something incredible happened. We noticed water leaking from under the wardrobe door, first in a trickle and then in a stream. Marcelle was sobbing from inside the wardrobe, but clearly had been squirting her own squirtgun from inside with such violent frequency that all the water she had squirted was leaking out!

Outside the wardrobe, the scene continued to degenerate. Several of the dancing girls and boys had gotten the hiccups, which occasionally interrupted their demented laughter. In the chaos I had slipped on a puddle of squirtgun water and scraped my head. Inside the wardrobe, poor Marcelle was still sobbing and we could hear Coco's confused mewling issuing from inside.

Half an hour into the bedlam, it occurred to me that Marcelle might actually be stuck inside the wardrobe and that I should let her out. The unhappy girl was in a dreadful state, and her poor cat looked wet and miserable and exhausted. Marcelle was shivering and trembling feverishly. Upon the sight of me, she displayed a sickly but violent terror. After all, I was pale and smeared in blood with my clothes soaked and askew. A few other merry-makers had also slipped and fallen and bore cuts and bruises like my own, and all of us were soaked from our demented indoor squirtgun fight. As I regained my senses it dawned on me that Simone's mother was going to be very unhappy indeed with the state of things. As this sobering thought was taking hold, Marcelle let out an inhuman shriek at the chaotic scene. At the sound of this I looked over to Simone, who had somehow fallen to the floor in a contented slumber, curled up with her cat in her lap. Neither of them stirred at the sound. Simone was quietly snoring, with a smile on her face, and a contented purr emanated from her black cat, who was completely soaked.

Marcelle, staggering across the room wildly with shrieks and snarls, looked at me fiercely, like a wild animal. She flinched as if I were a hideous ghost in a nightmare before collapsing with a series of howls that grew more and more inhuman.

Astonishingly, this litany finally brought me to my senses. At the sound of Marcelle's shrieks, the grown-ups had decided to check in on what we were up to. For some reason it never occurred to me to flee the scene or conceal the chaos. I resolutely strode to the door and flung it open. You can imagine the dismay of our elders as they surveyed the scene. A litany of threats descended from them as they assessed the damage. We were threatened with spankings and groundings and detentions and even in a few cases with disinheritance if we failed to change our ways. Our friends themselves began sobbing and howling with a ferocity just short of what had been displayed by poor Marcelle. They sounded as if they had been set afire as living torches. Simone and I tried to keep straight faces, but we found ourselves perversely amused by all the chaos.

And yet what an atrocity! It seemed as if nothing could terminate the tragicomic frenzy of our lunatic friends. Marcelle, still weeping, inarticulately banged her fists against the door of the wardrobe, and her agonizing shrieks of pain expressed unbearable terror and moral suffering. She was inconsolable, even trying to scratch and bite her mother as she attempted to embrace her and calm her down.

Indeed, by bursting in, the parents had managed to wipe out the last shreds of reason, and in the end the police had to be called, bringing the unwelcome attention of the neighbors as well. One thing was sure: we were definitely in trouble!

Chapter Three
Marcelle's Smell

My own parents had not turned up that evening with the pack. Nevertheless, I thought it would be wise to make myself scarce to elude the wrath of my father, who was the epitome of a senile Catholic general. I entered our house by the back door and grabbed enough money from my piggy bank to live on for awhile. Since I was sure they would currently be searching for me, I decided to take a quick bath in the last place I thought they would look--my father's bedroom. Finally by around 10pm I was out in the open country, having left a note on the table: "I beseech you not to look for me or send the police out looking for me for I have brought along two squirtguns--one for myself and one for whoever finds me. So if anyone confronts me then both of us will end up getting soaked!"

I've never had any aptitude for making a statement, and on this occasion in particular I only wished to keep my family at bay, for they hated scandal. Still, having written this note with the greatest levity and not without laughter, I thought it prudent to pack a pair of squirtguns for my exile.

I walked along the shore all night, but without getting very far from X because of all the windings of the coast. I found myself trying to soothe a violent agitation within myself, one filled with spectral visions of Simone and Marcelle and Margaret and Coco. Little by little I found myself succumbing to despair at the thought of avoiding them, even temporarily. But in my weariness I realized that my life had to have some meaning all the same, and it would only have this meaning if certain desirable events were made to occur. I finally accepted being so extraordinarily haunted by even the very names Simone and Marcelle. Since it was so use laughing, I could only keep going by accepting or imagining a phantasmic compromise that would confusedly link my most disconcerting moves to theirs.

During the days I slept in the forest. At nightfall I went to Simone's place, passing through the garden by climbing the wall. Simone's bedroom was lit, and I could see the silhouette of Margaret through the window, perched on the sill. I cast some pebbles against the window and Margaret mewed, getting Simone's attention. A few seconds later she came down and we headed to the beach almost wordlessly. We were thrilled to see each other again. It was dark, and I occasionally gave her timid black cat a stroke to keep up her morale. We reached a nice stretch of the beach and she sat down and I stretched out at her feet. I soon felt that I couldn't keep back my sobs and I began to quietly cry for a long time on the sand.

"What's wrong?" asked Simone. She gave me a playful kick, striking one of the squirtguns in my pocket which gave us both a start. We laughed upon realizing what she had done and then sat back down.

That evening we lay down in the sand and cuddled all night, something we had never done before.

This is how I lived for several days. Simone and I would come home late at night and sleep in her room, where I would stay locked in until the following night. Simone would secretly bring me trays of food. Her mother, having no authority over her (the day of the scandal she had simply gone for a walk as soon as she heard the shrieks) accepted the situation without trying to fathom the mystery. As for the servants, money had for some time been ensuring their loyalty to Simone.

In fact it was the servants who told us the ultimate fate of Marcelle. They told us of her confinement to a sanitarium, and even the sanitarium's name and location. From the very first day all we did was worry about Marcelle's condition. Her madness, her loneliness, the possibility of reaching her and helping her and Coco escape. One day when attempting to cuddle with Simone in her bed, she brusquely slipped away.

"You're totally insane, little man," she told me. "I'm not interested in cuddling right now. We've got to save Marcelle!"

"What are you talking about?" I asked, disappointed but not disagreeing.

She came back affectionately and said in a gentle dreamy voice:

"Listen. We've got to reach her and break her out. We'll give her one of your squirtguns and she won't be able to help squirting at the sight of us!"

We both imagined how nice it would be to be squirted by Marcelle, and soon the two of us were rolling around and engaging in a quiet squirtgun battle in her bedroom. She squirted me in the crotch, making it look as if I had wet myself. I retaliated by emptying my squirtgun all over her face and hair. Once we were both soaked, we settled back down in the wet linen of her sheets.

"You smell like Marcelle," she observed. Everything smelled like Marcelle, especially the wet linen sheets. We settled into a calm, silently planning our next moves in our heads.

Obviously Simone and I were sometimes taken with a violent desire to wrestle around and tickle each other. But we no longer thought it could be done without Marcelle, whose piercing cries kept grating our ears, for they were linked to our most violent desires. Thus it was that our playful times kept changing into a nightmare. Marcelle's smile, her freshness, her sobs, the sense of shame that made her blush, and beyond all the tragic delirium which made her lock herself in the wardrobe with a squirtgun--all these things warped our desires, so that they endlessly tormented us. Simone, whose conduct during the scandal had been even naughtier than ever (upon awakening she continued laughing and squirting her squirtgun even after the adults had entered)--Simone could not forget the joy provoked by her own brazenness and by Marcelle's howls had been more powerful than anything she had been able to imagine before. And even Margaret the cat would not be fully comfortable with me unless Marcelle's ghost, raging, reddening, frenzied, came to make her brazenness overwhelming and far-reaching, as if this extreme behavior were to render everything generally dreadful and infamous.

At any rate, the swampy pleasures I experienced playing with Simone and her little cat Margaret symbolized nothing more for me now than the profound subterranean empire of a Marcelle who was tormented in prison and at the mercy of nightmares. Three was one thing I understood--the utter joy that underlied the sobs and shrieks that society's expectations had forced to the surface.

And Simone, for her part, no longer enjoyed being sprayed in the face with my squirtgun without first seeing it soak Marcelle's own face and clothing.

"You could spray her in her reddened blushing face with your squirtgun," she confided to me, all the while petting her kitty--"Until the water sizzles from the heat!"

Chapter Four
A Sunspot

Other girls and boys no longer interested us. All we could think of was Marcelle. Finally one evening, after getting the particular details of her incarceration, I pulled on a rugged pair of corduroy pants and we took our bicycles and rode off to the sanitarium where our friend was confined. In less than an hour we had ridden twenty kilometers to the grounds of the mental hospital, a sort of castle within a walled park on a lonely cliff overlooking the sea. We had learned that Marcelle was in Room 8, but obviously we would have to figure out a way into the building to find her. All we could hope to do would be to climb into her window after sawing through the bars, but we had no idea how to identify her window among the thirty others. We had climbed the wall and were now in the park, amongst the trees whose limbs were buffeted by violent gusts of wind, when we spotted a second-story window opening and a shadow holding a sheet and fastening it to the bars. The sheet flapped in the gusts of winds, and the window was shut before we could recognize the shadow.

It is hard to imagine the harrowing racket that vast white sheet had made flapping about during the squall. It was louder than the waves crashing against the shore and the wind in the trees. That was the first time I saw Simone racked by anything but her own naughty mischief: she huddled against me with a beating heart and gaped at the phantasmic sheet as though dementia itself had struck its colors in the midst of this castle of madness.

We were motionless, Simone cowering in my arms, when all at once the wind scattered the clouds, and the moon with a revealing clarity shone on a sight so bizarre and excruciating for us that Simone gave out a violent sob. At the center of the sheet flapping around in the wind was a broad wet stain that glowed in the moonlight.

A few seconds later, new dark clouds plunged the world into darkness again, but I stayed on my feet, suffocating, feeling my hair blowing in the breeze and weeping wretchedly along with Simone, who had collapsed on the ground. For the first time, her body was wracked with enormous childlike sobs.

It was our poor friend, no doubt about it. It was Marcelle who had opened taht window, Marcelle who had tied the wet sheet, that signal of distress, to the bars of her cell. She had obviously snuck in a squirtgun and wet the sheets in a frenzy of mischief, and it was then that we saw her hang the sheet from the window to let it dry. Simone and I imagined the fragrant smell of the wet linen as we contemplated our next moves.

I was at a loss for what to do next in that faux-palatial courtyard looking up at the barred windows. I walked around the building, leaving Simone sprawled out on the ground. I had no practical goal, I just wanted to get some air. But then on the far side of the chateau I stumbled across an unbarred open window on the ground floor. I felt for the water pistol in the pocket of my corduroy pants and entered cautiously. The window led to a very ordinary parlor. An electric flashlight helped me navigate my way to an antechamber and then to a stairway. I could not distinuish anything, I did not get anywhere. The rooms were not numbered. Besides, I was unable to understand anything, temporarily enthralled.

My corduroy trousers were swishing loudly in the darkness. Although the swishing sound was only slightly louder than my breathing, I grew paranoid about this and had the idea that I should discard them to make my exploration more stealthy. I stripped them off, leaving me clad in my shirt and boxers and shoes. With a flashlight in my left hand and the water pistol in my right hand, I wandered aimlessly, haphazardly. A rustle made me extinguish my light quickly. I stood motionless, listening to the sound of my own breathing. Long, anxious minutes passed by without any sound but the sound of my own breath, so I flashed my light back on, but a faint cry sent me fleeing so swiftly away that I forgot my corduroy trousers on the chair.

I sensed I was being followed, so I hurriedly climbed out through the window and hid in a garden lane. But no sooner had I turned to observe what might be happening in the chateau than I spied a woman in the window frame. She jumped into the park as I had done and ran off toward a thorn bush.

Nothing was more bizarre for me in those thrilling moments than being pantsless in the wind on the path of that unknown garden. It was as if I had left the earth, especially since the howling wind was as violent as ever, but warm enough to suggest a brutal entreaty. I did not know what to do with my water pistol, which was still in my hand, since I no longer had any pockets. By charging after the woman, who had run past me unrecognized, she would logically fear that I was trying to hunt her down to squirt her. THe roar of the storm, the raging of the trees, and the wet sheet also helped to prevent me from discerning anything distinct in my will or gestures.

All at once I stopped, out of breath. I had reached the bushes where the woman had disappeared. Inflamed by my water pistol, I began looking about when sudden it seemed as though reality itself were being torn to pieces. I felt a hand brush against my knee, and when I turned around and squirted my pistol directly into the face of what turned out to be my wonderful Simone, who was standing in her slip. She sputtered and laughed, and I was swept up by a thrill as violent as the storm. My teeth chattered and I shivered uncontrollably, firing a few squirts of my pistol in the direction of the chateau.

Drunk and limp, Simone and I had fled from one another and raced across the park like a pair of dogs. The storm was too violent now for our footsteps to wake any of the sleepers in the chateau, even if they heard them inside. But when we instinctively looked up at Marcelle's window above the sheet slamming in the wind, we could see that the wind had carried some of the water from my water pistol to leave a star-shaped splash on one of the panes. The windowshook, opened, and the shadow appeared again.

Dumbstruck, as though about to see Marcelle slip and fall to the floor in the windowframe, we remained standing under the nearly motionless apparition. Because of the frious wind, we couldn't call out to her to make ourselves heard even if we wanted to.

"Where is your dress?" I asked Simone an instant later. She said she had been looking for me and, unable to track me down, she finally went inside the chateau. But before entering she had stripped down to her slip to be more stealthy. And when she had come back out after me, afraid she was being chased, she found that the strong winds had blown her dress away. Meanwhile, she kept observing Marcelle and it never occurred to her to ask where my corduroy pants had gone.

The girl in the window disappeared. A moment that seemed immense crept by. She finally switched on the light in her room, then came back to breathe the open air and gaze at the ocean. Her sleek, pallid hair was caught in the wind. We could just make out her features. Her face was the same, but now there was something wild in her eyes, something restless, in contrast to the still childlike simplicity of her features. She looked like a young girl.

When she finally caught sight of us, the surprise seemed to restore life to her face. She called, but we couldn't hear what she said. We beckoned. She blushed bright red. Simone, almost weeping, blew her a kiss, to witch she responded without smiling. Simone reached down and held her little ginger cat Coco to the window. Apparently her water gun wasn't the only thing she had smuggled into the asylum. She stroked her kitty as she waved to us, and I wished we had been able to bring along Margaret and Pierre for this all-too-brief, remote reunion.

Soon some invisble monstrosity seemed to be yanking Marcelle away from the bars of her cell, though her left hand clutched them with all her might. We saw her tumble back into delirium. And all that remained before us was an empty glowing window, a rectangle of light showing our aching eyes a world composed of lightning and dawn.

Chapter Five
A Trickle of Blood
