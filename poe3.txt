Breaking In

I'm still making friends
With my new boots
Leather and bone
With suffering flesh
In-between
Nobody's perfect
In time we'll settle
For each other

Rapid Chess

Is like fucking
With a ten minute
Timer
Not how I want to be judged
Or remembered

Smile

Mama wolf taught me
Don't show your teeth
Unless you're going to use them

Four Hours from Leon's

1.

Moth eyes
Every light source a heart
Slowly fluttering home in the cold

2.

Sister wolf
Snarling at the jackals
Skateboard for a crutch
Never let them see you wounded

3.

When your timing is bad
Sometimes you lose an hour
Just by existing
Keep your eyes peeled
There may be coyotes about

4.

Egyptian princess
My face in your halo of pepper
Like being kissed
By a swarm of gnats

The Death of Lesbia's Cat

Mourn, O Bastet and Sekhmet
And all lovers of cats!
My girl's plump little panther is dead!
Her frosty feline, her sweet chilly treat
She loved more than her own wide hazel eyes,
For he was kind to her and he loved her,
With her eyes still wet from the loss of her mother.
He sat, stiff and stoic in her lap
Frozen feline frankfurter
An icy mummy swaddled in a soggy bun
Thawing slowly with silent purrs
Audible to his mistress alone.
His soul waddles its way down the shadowy road,
Heart awaiting measure against Maat's feather.
Curses to you, Anubis,
Jackal who steals each thing of beauty
From our bleak and bitter world!
Oh thief! Oh poor sweet gentle cat!
Now tears flow from my girl's bulging eyes
To drip onto his tombless corpse.

Identity

Remember
In real life
As in mathematics
You always have the choice
To do nothing
But this too is a choice
Choose it wisely

Zugzwang

Remember
In chess
You do not have the choice
To do nothing
But neither does your opponent



Homomorphisms

There's not necessarily anything
Special
About homomorphisms
They may or may not do something
Magical
But they don't do anything
Stupid

The Charles Mingus CAT-alog for Toilet Training Your Cat

Your noble cat should strive to be a king
And ready to replace you on your throne.
You sit in judgment, he rubs your bare calves
And perches in your puddled trouser legs
Or strives to swing upon the fragrant hammock
Formed by underpants around your knees

Before a cat can swing a cat must dance
Before a cat can dance a cat must walk
So fundamentals first
Your cat must master the modest musty box
That sits in the far corner
Awaiting his squats and squirts

A simple cardboard box will do the trick--
Mind the bottom, it must be one piece
And solid and smooth and strong
Add a false bottom if need be
A sympathetic grocer can supply
A suitable piece that is cut to size

Use newspaper instead of sand--the time
Will come where all must go into the drain
Newspaper flushes--sand, alas does not.
Make sure to shred the paper finely first
So that your cat is not inclined to read
Troubling news during his toilet time
Which should relieve him of his earthly burdens
Not saddle him with more.

Move the box around, the cat will follow
He knows by nose the place where he should shit
Do this subtly, syncopate a bit
Get the cat to think about the groove
Or else he'll end up crapping on the downbeat
A sad confused square clapping on the ones

As the box moves round, cut down the sides
Slowly, to prepare him for the moment
When he will be without a box at all;
The rim is not there for his privacy
But still this is an anxious time for him
As he must bury all his dirty deeds
Within a grave more shallow day by day

The next step is a quantum leap for sure
Cut slats into the shrinking litterbox
So it may be lashed to the toilet seat
Don't bug the cat--he must decide himself
To follow this diminishing old vessel
To its new home perched over a cyclone

Once he has followed, start to add less paper
Gradually as if his cardboard ship
Had sprung a leak upon the stormy sea
This change may give your cat cause for alarm
So do not rush him, do not make him fear
His fragile raft is sinking in the depths

One day, once your brave cat has proved his mettle
Cut a small round hole into the box
A size where a plump plum may plummet through
But which would be plugged by an ample apple
Leave paper near the hole awhile so that
It may continue soaking up the waste

Your cat will quickly notice this new hole
And if you're lucky he will show no fear
Directing his spray down into the void
And maybe even kicking down some paper

Night Life

Sometimes you ask a lot of me
My friend
I struggle to keep pace
My bowl's not empty
But I can see the bottom
And I can feel the hunger creeping in
Even with my belly full

I knew the comfort of sand beneath my paws
Long before I danced for treats
In your cold apartment
Teased by a beaver dangled on a string

Your torn up newsprint doesn't confuse me
Same box
Same concept

We don't speak the same language
But you still claim to read my simple mind
And I can sense the genius
In your irregular rhythms
As your fingers pluck strange notes
Down in the range where I both growl and purr

It's true that you can't train a cat
We must make up our own minds
To do the things you want us to do
As if it was our idea all along

You move my shrinking box around
I try to follow
This part isn't hard
But you misread my stress as confusion
I know where my box is
I don't know what you're up to
Or what you'll ask of me next

A cat should be cool
I'm trying to be cool
I lick my paws
I groom myself 'til my tongue bleeds
Well out of your sight

You're a strange cat yourself, Chuck
You stress me out
But your lap is so comfortable...

***

Something's up
Chuck
Don't think that I didn't notice
You're not making things hard
You're just making them weird

Are we back to square one?

Your walk up in the Bowery was a comfort
The night you took me in
Scraping me off the street limping
Thinking me a cripple
Just for the night...
You tossed a cardboard box into your claw foot tub
Wadded up some newspapers
And hoped for the best
The box didn't even have a proper bottom
And my piss leaked out onto the porcelain
You lost your cool and swore at me
And at yourself
I forgive you Chuck
But I didn't forget...

You fed me rich food that upset my stomach
(Let's face it, it upset yours too)
And when I sought my box out it had moved
Into the corner of a different room
Sitting on an old towel
Just in case

A decision needed to be made
I went back to the tub anyway
You hadn't even rinsed it out

I didn't want to make things worse
Not my proudest moment

You swore again on seeing what I'd done
And ran the water
Rinsed the mostly liquid mess
Down into the drain
And scrubbed it all with acrid vinegar

You seized me by the scruff
With your strong callused fingers
And dragged me to the box
And placed me in it
Paws first
And I could feel the bottom you'd swapped out
With fresh dry cardboard you had cut to size
I tried to squirm away in shame
But then
You picked me up and held me in your arms
And cried
Deciding if I were a Liability
Or a Project...

It was weird

Once I had sand beneath my paws
And a proper box
Made of solid plastic
On a tile floor
Next to a hand broom and dustpan
But I outlived my usefulness
As a companion
So here we are...

We're both nocturnal creatures, Chuck
Me by nature
You by choice, by profession
We curl up and nap in the warm sun each day
You called me Night Life when you let me stay
The first thing you got right
It's better than my other name
I dig it

You feed me when you remember to
It's cool
I was spoiled before
And comfortably plump
But beggars can't be choosers
And I can still hunt if I need to
My claws remain sharp

My little cardboard boat's almost a raft
Sides whittled down
And creeping closer back toward the tub
What the fuck
Chuck?
